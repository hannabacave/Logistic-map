Logistic_module is a package allowing the vizualisation of three elements :

   1) The link between logistic map and Mandebrot fractals ;

   2) The Mandelbrot set in 2D and an animation showing a zoom in its depth ;

   3) The Mandelbrot set in 3D and an animation showing all its sides.
   

Hope you can find in this package something to satisfy your curiosity !
